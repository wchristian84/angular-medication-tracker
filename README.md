## About

A simple app for users to keep track of what medications they are currently taking and what ones they've taken in the past. My wife has an autoimmune disorder, so she's been on lots of medications over the years, making it difficult to remember what she's been on and when; this web app was designed with people in similar situations (particularly those with chronic illnesses) have an easier time documenting their medication history.

## Searching

The app contains a search function that queries the FDA's medication database API. You can directly add medications from the results page, with names and dosages pre-filled for you.

## Schedule

The schedule component displays what days and times you need to take each of your current medications for which you've supplied date/time information. Previously taken medications will never show up on the schedule.
